    & Include a summary of thesis and work done over the course of my PhD with emphasis on the most important results/contributions.

    & Mention the direction the semi-visible jet and Higgs to invisible analyses can take (sharing ideas/strategies I have, potential improvements with more LHC data and future prospects from potential future experiments).

    && SVJ has the t-channel and boosted searches underway, so those could yield interesting results. Long-lived searches are also an option. Higher energy collider like FCC gives larger range of phase space to explore

    && For Higgs to invisible, precision collider like FCC-ee or ILC might be required to actually observe the process (assuming it's BR is around SM value). Otherwise, we just need a lot of LHC data to narrow down the BR if it is enhanced by some BSM process.

    && Both searches can be improved with better ML techniques and stuff for categorisation/background rejection.
