## CERN accelerator complex

As stated in the document, the figure comes from <https://stfc.ukri.org/research/particle-physics-and-particle-astrophysics/large-hadron-collider/cern-accelerator-complex/>. I think I just right-clicked and saved the image.

## CMS cutaway diagram

As stated in the document, the figure comes from <http://cds.cern.ch/record/2665537/>. Specifically, the image is from <http://cds.cern.ch/record/2665537/files/cms_160312_06.pdf?version=1>.

## Cross section of CMS to show eta bounds

As stated in the document, the figure comes from <https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/5/1/18>. Specifically, the image is from <https://www.mdpi.com/universe/universe-05-00018/article_deploy/html/images/universe-05-00018-g009.png>. I think I downloaded the png or screenshotted it from the paper itself and converted it to pdf.

## CMS data flow

As stated in the document, the figure is reproduced from <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/12/02/C02014>. I reproduced it in PowerPoint (the main file being [CMS_L1T_data_flow.pptx](CMS_L1T_data_flow.pptx)). Several permutations are stored within this file in case the one I've currently included in the thesis is unsatisfactory.

## Integrated luminosity and pileup in Run-2

As stated in the document, the figures come from <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/LumiPublicResults>. Specifically, the image of the luminosity is from <https://cern.ch/cmslumi/publicplots/int_lumi_cumulative_pp_2_run2.pdf>, while pileup is from <https://cern.ch/cmslumi/publicplots/pileup_allYears_run2.pdf>.

## Jet energy corrections

These are made when running the JEC workflow. I would just need to follow my instructions (probably best described in section 20 of my [lab book](https://github.com/eshwen/lab-book)) to make new plots. Otherwise, I have a copy of all JEC plots from all iterations on my iCloud Drive if I want to use different ones.

The scatter plots are normally generated in png. I converted them to pdf in Preview to reduce the compilation time of the thesis document itself.

## Transverse slice through CMS

As stated in the document, the figure comes from <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04965>. I downloaded the source containing the pdf image.
