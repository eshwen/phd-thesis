Remember:
- Add the variable replacements (region, category, lepton)
- Use the right x-axis limits so there's no horizontal space between the histograms and axis limits
- Add the bin widths on the y-axis label
- Make sure signal line colours are consistent
- Make sure status annotation next to "CMS" is correct, i.e., Preliminary/Work in progress/no annotation
- Make sure any plots in the ggF categories are labelled/annotated with "ggH", not "ggF"
