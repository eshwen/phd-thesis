\section{Interpretations in simplified dark matter scenarios}
\label{sec:htoinv_dark_matter_models}

The results of the analysis fail to observe the Higgs boson to invisible state process, with an upper limit on the branching ratio much larger that the \acrlong{sm} prediction. However, limits on certain properties of dark matter may be set. One \acrshort{bsm} interpretation is presented on a Higgs portal model where the \acrshort{sm} Higgs boson acts as the mediator. The same procedure is followed as described in Ref.~\citenum{Sirunyan:2018owy}.

\subsection{Higgs portal model with the standard model Higgs boson}
\label{subsec:htoinv_dark_matter_higgs_portal}

An interpretation of the results in this thesis may be in terms of a simplified Higgs portal model---coupling the dark sector to the visible where the \acrshort{sm} Higgs boson acts as the mediator bridging them~\cite{Djouadi:2011aa}. An effective field theory approach assumes that the invisible decays of the Higgs boson result in the pair production of dark matter particles \Pqdark, with a rate constrained by the upper limit on $\BRof{\higgstoinv}$. If the dark matter mass $\mqdark < m_{\PH}/\text{2}$, on-shell production allows the translation of the \higgstoinv width $\Gamma_{\mathrm{inv.}}$ into the spin-independent $\Pqdark$-nucleon scattering cross section \xsecSI. The interaction between dark and baryonic matter may be mediated by a Higgs boson, making direct detection experiments particularly sensitive to the recoil. The sensitivity of these experiments is typically parametrised by \xsecSI as a function of $\mqdark$. Comparisons can therefore be made between direct detection and collider experiments.

The \acrshort{lhc} has the ability to probe smaller dark matter masses $\order{\text{1--10}\GeV}$ better than direct detection experiments. Light dark matter still results in \ptvecmiss from a collision, but does not transfer much momentum when scattering against a heavy nucleus such as xenon, resulting in a weaker signature.

In this Higgs portal model, two cases are considered: the dark matter candidate is a scalar, or a Majorana fermion. The branching ratio is $\BRof{\higgstoinv} = \Gamma_{\mathrm{inv.}}/(\Gamma_{\mathrm{SM}} + \Gamma_{\mathrm{inv.}})$, where it is assumed $\Gamma_{\mathrm{SM}} = \text{4.07}\MeV$~\cite{Heinemeyer:1559921}. From Ref.~\citenum{Djouadi:2011aa}, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{inv.}}$ can be calculated for scalar $\Pqdark_{S}$ and fermion dark matter $\Pqdark_{f}$ as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
\Gamma^{\mathrm{inv.}}_{\PH \rightarrow \Pqdark_{S}\Pqdark_{S}} &= \frac{ \lambda^2_{\PH SS} v^2 \beta_S }{64\pi m_{\PH}},\\[0.5em]
\Gamma^{\mathrm{inv.}}_{\PH \rightarrow \Pqdark_{f}\Pqdark_{f}} &= \frac{ \lambda^2_{\PH ff} v^2 m_{\PH} \beta_f^3 }{ 32\pi \Lambda^2 },
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the coupling (scaled by $\Lambda$ in the case of fermions), $v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the \acrshort{sm} Higgs field, and $\beta_i = \sqrt{1 - 4m_{\Pqdark_i}^2/m_{\PH}^2}$. The masses of the dark matter particles $\mqdark$ are the physical masses after electroweak symmetry breaking with this new Higgs field. The spin-independent $\Pqdark$-nucleon scattering cross sections are
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
\sigma^{\mathrm{SI}}_{\Pqdark_{S}-N} &= \frac{\lambda^2_{\PH SS} }{ 16 \pi m_{\PH}^4} \frac{ m_N^4 f_N^2 }{ (m_{\Pqdark_{S}} + m_N)^2 },\\[0.5em]
\sigma^{\mathrm{SI}}_{\Pqdark_{f}-N} &= \frac{\lambda^2_{\PH ff} }{ 4 \pi \Lambda^2 m_{\PH}^4} \frac{ m_N^4 m_{\Pqdark_{f}}^2 f_N^2 }{ (m_{\Pqdark_{f}} + m_N)^2 },
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $f_N$ parametrises the Higgs-nucleon coupling. The value $f_N = \text{0.308} \pm \text{0.018}$ is taken from Ref.~\citenum{Hoferichter:2017olk}. Limits on these cross sections as a function of dark matter mass are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgs_portal_dm_limits}, computed at 90\,\% confidence level to compare with direct detection experiments, whose latest results are also presented.

For $\BRof{\higgstoinv} < \text{0.28}$ observed at a 95\,\% confidence level (corresponding to 0.24 at a 90\,\% confidence level) in this thesis, the Higgs portal models assuming scalar and fermion dark matter candidates set the lowest limits on \xsecSI for \mqdark below 7 and 15\GeV, respectively.
