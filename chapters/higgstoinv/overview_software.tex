\section{Overview of the analysis}
\label{sec:htoinv_analysis_overview}

The analysis discussed in the remainder of the chapter is a dedicated search for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons in hadronic final states, incorporating two of the four main production modes. In contrast to many of the previous analyses that separately set limits on $\BRof{\higgstoinv}$ by reinterpretation, this approach has many benefits. A simultaneous search for several production modes allows the construction of search regions to target each one, embedding orthogonality to avoid overlap between them. Data and simulation samples, recipes for corrections and systematic uncertainties, the analysis framework, and results can all be shared to provide a cohesive and consistent environment from which to perform the analysis. As well as streamlining the process of the final combination over each production mechanism, communication when establishing the analysis ensures each can cover as much phase space as possible without the trouble of overlap or contamination.

Direct collaboration between the University of Bristol and Imperial College London divides up the task of analysing the various Higgs boson production modes appropriately. This thesis focuses on \ttH, \VH and \ggH mechanisms. Those at Imperial College London, who have a long history with the \acrshort{vbf} search~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014tja,Sirunyan:2018owy}, assume responsibility of this process. Results will be shared between the institutes after the publication of this document to achieve a fully combined limit on $\BRof{\higgstoinv}$.

\subsection{Analysis strategy}
\label{subsec:htoinv_analysis_strategy}

The analysis targets \ttH and \VH as they are novel dedicated searches. Given the \acrshort{lhc} is a \emph{hadron} collider, hadronic final states are naturally chosen for this analysis. \Gls{met} from the purely-invisible decay of the Higgs---and hadronic activity from the particles associated with the production mechanism---constitute the final state, often known as a ``\text{\glspl{jet}} $+$ \ptvecmiss'' search. In lieu of this, the dominant background processes from the \acrlong{sm} include \acrshort{qcd} with high \gls{jet} multiplicity, invisible decays of the \PZ boson, and those where the leptons from the decay are ``lost'' (\lostlepton) from misidentification or are outside the bounds of the detector acceptance. The latter is predominantly populated by \ttbar and leptonically decaying \PW bosons. To accurately estimate their presence in the signal region of the analysis, dedicated methods are employed. \Glspl{CR} separated by lepton and photon multiplicity predict the lost lepton and \ztonunu processes. Sidebands to the signal region, where one or two selections otherwise designed to reject \acrshort{qcd} multijet events are inverted, give rise to phase spaces enriched in them. A data-driven approach utilises these to predict the multijet background in the signal region.

Definitions of the physics objects used analysis-wide have already been discussed in Chpt.~\ref{sec:analysis_objects}. The data from \acrshort{cms} and from simulation are reported in Chpt.~\ref{sec:htoinv_data_sim}. Categorisation of events to highlight the production modes is illustrated in Chpts.~\ref{sec:htoinv_categorisation}. These are further separated into the various phase space regions in Chpt.~\ref{sec:region_definitions}. Application of the event selection in Chpt.~\ref{sec:htoinv_event_selection} is intended to separate signal from background and discard poorly measured events. Many cuts are universal, though some are category- or region-specific to mitigate problems found only there, or to further separate signal and background. Corrections to simulation, designed to describe the data more accurately, and associated systematic uncertainties are discussed in Chpt.~\ref{sec:htoinv_mc_corrections}. The culmination of all of the aforementioned sections is in the fit of signal and background simultaneously in the signal and \glspl{CR} to data in Chpt.~\ref{sec:htoinv_satistical_treatment}. Estimation of the dominant background processes from the \glspl{CR} and \glspl{SB}---and how they are incorporated into the fit---are as well documented. Results of the analysis of each production mode are illustrated in Chpt.~\ref{sec:htoinv_results}. A full combination of all modes and data taking years to yield the final result close the chapter in Chpt.~\ref{sec:htoinv_combined_results} along with interpretations in simplified dark matter scenarios.

\section{Only tools and forces: software and toolkits}
\label{sec:htoinv_software}

Analysing high energy physics data is a long and complex task with many stages that must be stitched together. In the analysis described in this chapter, the first step involves a light skim---or reduction of events---of the remotely-available datasets is effectuated with \nanoAODtools.\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/nanoAOD-tools} for the original fork of the repository.} Operating on the nanoAOD data tier, the repository contains centrally-maintained corrections and systematic uncertainties related to physics objects. Custom modules are applied on top. Processing the datasets on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, output is stored on networked university storage elements for improved performance of the later stages of the analysis.

Skimmed data is analysed predominantly using the FAST set of tools, developed by colleagues at the University of Bristol. A suite of packages harmoniously work together to run most components of an analysis. The event selection and categorisation, as well as many studies and measurements of the data are conducted at this stage. Use of vectorisation and industry-standard Python libraries such as \textsf{numpy} and \textsf{pandas} allow complex and efficient processing with simple syntax. Visualisation can also be achieved with interfaces to \textsf{matplotlib}.

Output from the previous stage is processed through the fit of signal and background to data. Specification of all aspects are handled with the \textsf{HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit} package.\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/} for the repository.} A plethora of diagnostic information is available for understanding the effects of systematic uncertainties and other aspects of the analysis on the results.
