\section{Signal region, control region, and sideband definitions}
\label{sec:region_definitions}

Several regions of phase space are explored in the analysis. The signal region is accompanied by \glspl{CR} and \glspl{SB} to aid in the prediction of the \acrshort{sm} electroweak and \acrshort{qcd} multijet backgrounds, respectively. They are separated by the \acrshort{cms} datasets used, the \acrlong{hlt} requirements, and object and/or other kinematic selections.

\subsection{The signal region}
\label{subsec:htoinv_signal_region}

The signal region is the area of parameter space where we expect the signal to manifest, and the background to be reduced sufficiently that the potential presence of signal in data can be statistically verified. In this analysis, only hadronic final states are permitted. Events with leptons, photons and taus meeting the loose or veto criteria in Chpt.~\ref{sec:analysis_objects} are vetoed.

Events must satisfy a logical or of \acrshort{hlt} cross-triggers for \acrlong{pf} \ptmiss and \mht calculated without muons,\footnote{Why/how exactly is this done? Can muons fake jets, and so these calculations omit muons matched to jets at PF/HLT level?} and at least one \gls{jet} fulfilling the tight ID criteria (see Chpt.~\ref{sec:analysis_objects}). The triggers are illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_SR_triggers}.

The relative composition in each category of the signal region for signal and background are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:htoinv_sr_composition_comb2016to18}, highlighting the effectiveness to which the categories capture the targeted topologies, and the dominant background processes, respectively. The \ttH categories, especially those designed to tag boosted top quarks and vector bosons are very pure in \ttH. Similarly, the \VH categories predominantly consist of events from the production mode of focus. Contamination from the \acrshort{vbf} process is present at a low level, most notably in the resolved categories given the similar topologies. \ggH signal permeates several categories as the second largest component. This is likely due to its high cross section (more than ten times any other individual process) and its ability to mimic the final states of the other signals. \ttbarpjets is the dominant background for the \ttH categories as expected, with \ztonunupjets leading in the others. \wtolnupjets also contributes a reasonable fraction.

\subsection{Control regions}
\label{subsec:htoinv_control_regions}

\Glspl{CR} serve two complementary purposes in many analyses: the prediction of certain backgrounds that dominate in the signal region, as a more accurate method than using the yields directly from \acrlong{mc}; and to validate the data, \acrshort{mc}, and corrections or weights applied. They are orthogonal to the signal region and to each other by way of lepton or photon requirements, and by triggers that may pertain to those objects. \Glspl{CR} are also designed to, ideally, be devoid of signal. Contamination is sometimes present, but at a very small level. Five \glspl{CR} are used in the analysis: \singleMuCr \doubleMuCr, \singleEleCr \doubleEleCr, and \singlePhotonCr. The criteria for the objects---which are defined explicitly in Chpt.~\ref{sec:analysis_objects}---are summarised in the list below.
\medskip
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
    \easylistprops
    & \singleMuCr: one tight muon \tightMuon with $\pt > \text{20}\GeV$ and a transverse mass (as calculated in Eq.~\ref{eq:transverse_mass_massless}) in the range $\text{50} < \mtMuon < \text{110}\GeV$
    & \doubleMuCr: one tight muon \tightMuon with $\pt > \text{20}\GeV$, and one loose muon \looseMuon with $\pt > \text{10}\GeV$ that has opposite charge, with a combined invariant mass of $\text{60} < \doubleMuMass < \text{120}\GeV$ in the \VH categories, while instead $\text{75} < \doubleMuMass < \text{105}\GeV$ in the \ttH categories. The leading muon (regardless of whether it is the tight or loose one) is required to possess $\pt > \text{110}\GeV$
    & \singleEleCr: one tight electron \tightEle with $\pt > \text{40}\GeV$ and $\text{50} < \mtElectron < \text{110}\GeV$
    & \doubleEleCr: one tight electron \tightEle with $\pt > \text{40}\GeV$, and one veto electron \vetoEle with $\pt > \text{10}\GeV$ that has opposite charge, with a combined invariant mass of $\text{60} < \doubleEleMass < \text{120}\GeV$ in the \VH categories, while instead $\text{75} < \doubleEleMass < \text{105}\GeV$ in the \ttH categories. The leading electron (regardless of whether it is the tight or loose one) is required to possess $\pt > \text{110}\GeV$
    & \singlePhotonCr: one medium photon \mediumPhoton with $\pt > \text{230}\GeV$
\end{easylist}

\medskip

\noindent{}The \acrshort{qcd} suppression criteria from Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_categories} are applied in the signal region, but not to any of the \glspl{CR} in the \ttH category. This was to improve the statistical accuracy in the \glspl{CR}, notably in the otherwise sparsely-populated dilepton regions, and was found to avoid compromising the data--simulation agreement and the shapes of the important distributions. For the \VH category, the \acrshort{qcd} suppression criteria were included in the \glspl{CR} as the shape of the \ptmiss distribution was found to be different depending on whether the criteria were included or not. The \glspl{CR} in those categories were also not deficient in events, unlike in the case of \ttH.

The transverse mass cuts in the single lepton \glspl{CR} reduce the effect of signal contamination, specifically from \ttH since its \mT generally eclipses that of \ttbar.\footnote{The \mT for a \ttbar event with \ptvecmiss solely from the neutrino (in $\HepProcess{\Ptop \to \Pbottom\PW}$, $\HepProcess{\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu}$) should be in a window around the \PW mass. Introducing additional decay products such as the Higgs boson increase it.} The trigger requirements for the \singleMuCr and \doubleMuCr \glspl{CR} are the same as for the signal region (Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_SR_triggers}) since the same primary dataset is used.

In the \doubleMuCr and \doubleEleCr \glspl{CR}, the \doubleLepMass window is halved for the \ttH categories compared to the others to reduce contamination from \ttbar, granting a a higher purity \ztolplmpjets region. The leading lepton \pt requirement is increased in these regions for all categories also for purity purposes.

The \singleEleCr and \doubleEleCr \glspl{CR} take advantage of the increased statistical power of two primary datasets in both 2016 and 2017, characterised by electron and photon triggers. In 2018, they were merged into a single $\Pe/\Pphoton$ primary dataset. Tabs.~\ref{tab:htoinv_ele_pd_triggers} and~\ref{tab:htoinv_photon_pd_triggers} elucidate how the trigger requirements are specified for each year. As before, each quantity and object is defined at \acrshort{hlt} level. If an event aims to enter the \singleEleCr or \doubleEleCr, and is from the dataset of \Pe-based triggers, the criteria for either of the two triggers for the given year in Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_ele_pd_triggers} must be satisfied. If an event aims to enter either \gls{CR} and is from the primary dataset of \Pphoton-based triggers, the failure of both of the electron triggers in Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_ele_pd_triggers} and the passing of any of the photon triggers in Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_photon_pd_triggers} are required. This condition avoids double counting events that also appear in the electron trigger-based dataset. In 2018, any of the year's triggers in Tabs.~\ref{tab:htoinv_ele_pd_triggers} and~\ref{tab:htoinv_photon_pd_triggers} may be satisfied. For \acrlong{mc} events, as they are not categorised by trigger, they may pass any of the triggers in either table for their respective year.\footnote{See if I can describe the trigger requirements in a more elegant way. Might be easier give the descriptions and actual HLT path names a bit earlier, then just reference the HLT path names in the list.}

    \label{tab:htoinv_photon_pd_triggers}
\end{table}

In each of the \glspl{CR}, the \ptvecmiss is recalculated without the objects used to define said region to model the process it is predicting. In essence, these objects are treated as a source of missing momentum. Conditions in the event selection and binning that refer to \ptmiss use the recalculated quantity when applied to the \glspl{CR}. Using the \singleMuCr \gls{CR} as an example, the new \ptvecmiss is the vector sum of the old \ptvecmiss and the tight muon \ptvec. The single lepton \glspl{CR} estimate the semi-leptonic $\ttbarpjets$ and $\wtolnupjets$ backgrounds. In both cases, they may enter the signal region if the lepton is lost, becoming a source of \ptmiss. The dilepton and \singlePhotonCr regions consider \ztonunupjets. The former parallels the decay as it is enriched in \ztolplmpjets---possessing very similar kinematic properties while being much easier to detect, improving statistical accuracy. The latter region substitutes the \ztonunu decay with a photon.

The relative composition of the background processes in each \gls{CR} after the analysis-level selection is summarised in Fig.~\ref{fig:htoinv_cr_composition_comb2016to18}. As desired, the single lepton \glspl{CR} are very similar and dominated by the \ttbar and \wtolnu process, corresponding to the lost lepton backgrounds in the signal region. The dilepton regions also possess a very similar composition to each other, enriched in Drell-Yan \ztoll (a proxy for the \ztonunu background in the signal region), and to a lesser extent \ttbar and $\ttbar X$ which contain several dileptonic decay channels. In the \singlePhotonCr \gls{CR}, expectedly the \gammapjets process dominates virtually every category apart from a sizeable $\ttbar \Pphoton$ presence in some of the boosted \ttH cases. \acrshort{qcd} multijet events make up a consistent, small fraction of the events. Rather than the yields from \acrshort{mc} as they would likely consist of \glspl{jet} misidentified as photons, its presence in this region is estimated from a data driven purity measurement explained in Chpt.~\ref{subsubsec:htoinv_photon_purity}. Data and background yields from simulation from every \glspl{CR} in each period of Run-2 can be found in App.~\ref{app:supplementary_hinv_plots}.

\subsubsection{Photon purity measurement for the \texorpdfstring{\singlePhotonCr}{photon} control region}
\label{subsubsec:htoinv_photon_purity}

Photons are reconstructed from clusters in the \acrshort{ecal}. They can usually be discriminated from other sources leaving \acrshort{ecal} deposits due to the properties of the deposits themselves, as well as the lack of other signatures that typically belong to other particles. However, this method is imperfect, and occasionally other particles will incorrectly be identified as photons (known as ``fakes''). The leading sources of fake photons is from \acrshort{qcd} multijet events where a \gls{jet} is misidentified as such. Due to the high cross section of the process, even a small rate of fake photons becomes important to consider.

In order to separate real photons from fakes in the \singlePhotonCr \gls{CR}, a purity measurement is performed. We define the purity as the fraction of reconstructed photons that are from an isolated photon emerging from the hard scatter of the event, rather than a fake. The variable $\sieie$ is able to distinguish between real and fake photons with sufficient power. A peak with a hard cut off at $\sieie \approx \text{0.01}$ is observed for real photons, while fakes possess a less pronounced peak and much slower decline above that threshold. As such, we perform a template fit to the distribution in data to extract the purity.

As inputs to the fit, we select photons in data by applying the medium identification requirements in Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_photon_ID_barrel} with the exception of $\sieie$ to observe the full range. Photons from \singlePhotonCr simulation are selected with the same criteria and are used to define the real photon template. A fake photon template is obtained from data by requiring at least one of the isolation criteria from the medium ID in Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_photon_ID_barrel} to be unfulfilled. This ensures the photons from this set do not overlap with the real photons from data.

The templates are derived in separate bins of photon \pt, and the purity measurement is performed separately for each data taking year. The following event selection is applied:

\medskip
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
    \cutflowlistprops
    & Photon trigger requirement for the respective dataset from Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_photon_pd_triggers}
    & \ptmiss filters from Chpt.~\ref{subsec:htoinv_other_filters}
    & $\ptmiss < \text{60}\GeV$
    & At least one jet with $\pt > \text{80}\GeV$ and $\abseta < \text{2.4}$ that is separated from any photon with $\Delta R > \text{0.4}$
    & If a second jet is present, it is required to have $\pt > \text{40}\GeV$ and $\abseta < \text{2.4}$, also separated from any photon with $\Delta R > \text{0.4}$
    & $\HT > \text{200} \GeV$
\end{easylist}

\medskip

\noindent{}A combination of cuts are used to select photons appropriately and ensure the phase space resembles that of the \singlePhotonCr \gls{CR}. The shapes of the real and fake templates are fit to the data using a likelihood function in the range $\text{0.004} \leq \sieie \leq \text{0.02}$. By calculating the purity within acceptance (i.e., $\sieie \leq \text{0.01}$ as given by the medium ID requirement), the \emph{impurity} can be derived as a function of photon \pt. An exponential function is fitted to interpolate within the range that also serves to extrapolate above it. Fig.~\ref{fig:htoinv_photon_impurity} illustrates the impurity vs photon \pt for each data taking year. A 25\,\% uncertainty around the fit is assumed to account for effects related to the binning of the \sieie distribution.

% Plots from 4th August, 2020

The impurity expectedly decreases as as a function of the photon \pt. Harder particles are usually reconstructed better in the detector with more isolated deposits in the calorimeters while maintaining excellent momentum resolution. Several factors affecting the data quality in 2017 and 2018 could have led to the larger fake rates in the distributions, such as pre-firing and the HEM issue. Few issues were present in 2016. \acrlong{mc} in each year may have also impacted the measurement as the modelling parametes often differ between years.

In the analysis, the purity measurement is used to estimate the \acrshort{qcd} multijet background in the \singlePhotonCr \gls{CR}, replacing the contribution from \acrshort{mc}. For each event in data that enters the region, a \acrshort{qcd} multijet pseudo-event is created with the same properties---notably \ptmiss and photon \pt. The value of the impurity calculated from the photon's \pt weights the event. The new \acrshort{qcd} background is therefore generated with the same shape as the data and weighted to represent the rate of non-prompt photons. A 25\,\% uncertainty is attributed to the normalisation of the yield.

\subsection{Sidebands to the signal region}
\label{subsec:htoinv_sidebands}

As explained in Chpt.~\ref{subsec:htoinv_background}, it is difficult to accurately estimate the \acrshort{qcd} multijet content in the signal region. Several kinematic cuts in the analysis are designed to reject \acrshort{qcd} in the signal region, so by inverting one or more of them, it is possible to construct multijet-enriched regions: \emph{\glspl{SB}}.

The requirements are inverted for the \ttH category on the two angular variables designed to reject multijet events and optimise the categorisation of the production modes (see Chpt.~\ref{subsec:htoinv_cat_optimisation}). Several \glspl{SB} are constructed where each cut is inverted separately, and also when both are inverted. When the angular cut is inverted, the remaining phase space may be split into two \glspl{SB}, dubbed \emph{loose} and \emph{tight}. These are summarised in Tab.~\ref{tab:sideband_defs_ttH}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
        & $\omegaTilde < \text{0.2}$ & $\text{0.2} \leq \omegaTilde \leq \text{0.3}$ & $\omegaTilde > \text{0.3}$ \\\hline
        $\dphiFj > \text{0.5}$ & Tight \omegaTilde SB & Loose \omegaTilde SB & Signal region \\\hline
        $\dphiFj \leq \text{0.5}$ & Tight double SB & Loose double SB & \mindphi SB \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Definitions of the data sidebands used to determine the QCD multijet background in the signal region for the \ttH category]{Definitions of the \glspl{SB} (SBs) used to determine the \acrshort{qcd} multijet background in the signal region for the \ttH category.}
    \label{tab:sideband_defs_ttH}
\end{table}

The \glspl{SB} follow the same categorisation as for the other regions, i.e., Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_categories}, and are binned in \ptmiss with the same scheme as the other regions. A \gls{SB} composed of the inversion of only one variable maintains similar kinematic properties to the signal region. When performing analysis while still blind to data in the signal region, inspecting one of these \glspl{SB} is a good indicator of how new cuts or corrections will affect the signal region composition, and compatibility between data and \acrshort{mc}. Like the \glspl{CR}, \glspl{SB} serve a secondary purpose.

Events with a \VH topology, being characterised by a dijet pair or single fat jet recoiling from the \ptvecmiss, naturally has a large \mindphiJetMet. Obtaining a multijet enriched sideband by inverting this variable was therefore not possible. The sidebands inverted in \omegaTilde also contained little \acrshort{qcd} to extrapolate from. Therefore, a single sideband was created from the 2j0b category that inverts \mindphi, \omegaTilde (tightly, as with \ttH), and the dijet mass requirement from Tab.~\ref{tab:htoinv_categories}. The latter inversion populates the sideband sufficiently with multijet events. This sideband is utilised by all \VH categories, as while the 1V category does not enforce the same dijet mass window, the soft drop mass requirement for the boosted \PVec-tagged \gls{jet} is a suitable proxy. Inclusion of \glspl{bjet} in the 2j1b and 2j2b categories reduces the multijet content of potential sidebands significantly. This is considered suitable justification for these categories to also utilise the sideband constructed from 2j0b.

Figs.~\ref{fig:htoinv_sb_yields_comb2016to18_ttH} and \ref{fig:htoinv_sb_yields_comb2016to18_VH} illustrate the \ptmiss distributions in the \ttH and \VH \glspl{SB} after the analysis-level selections with the full Run-2 dataset. Background estimation is performed separately for each year due to the differing running conditions, detector configuration, and the different effects or problems seen in the data.
