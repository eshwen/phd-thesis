# Making plots for the introductory chapter

The following contains instructions to reproduce plots, or the sources from where I retrieved external plots, for the introductory chapter.

## Dark matter detection methods pseudo-Feynman diagram

As with the Feynman diagrams in the [theory chapter](../../theory/figures/), I used the interactive tool <https://feynman.aivazis.com/> to make this. See the [README](../../theory/figures/README.md#feynman-diagrams) for those figures for more information.

## Dark matter cross sections

As stated in the thesis, this plot comes from <https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11165>. Only the pdf download of the paper is available, unlike other cases where the source containing the image files is also available. I ended up just screenshotting the plot at high resolution to get it.
