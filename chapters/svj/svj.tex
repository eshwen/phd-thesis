\chapter{Search for dark matter through the production of semi-visible jets}
\label{chap:svj}

\initial{T}his is the analysis chapter on \glspl{svj}.

%=======
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
\ListProperties(Style*=-- , FinalMark={)}, Margin=0.5cm)
& Discuss how the theoretical aspects from the Theory chapter translate into an experimental search.
& Include object definitions, triggers, overall analysis strategy, signal production, event selection, background estimation and results/limit (including comparisons to similar searches -- monojet/dijet exotic searches).
& Emphasise my contributions: $s$- and $t$-channel signal model production and understanding. Angular variable study for \acrshort{qcd} background rejection (if used).
& Current material: no public plots as of yet. Hope to finish \schannel analysis soon (see previous section for caveats regarding inclusion), no timeline on \tchannel analysis.
