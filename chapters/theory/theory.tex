\begin{easylist}[itemize]
\ListProperties(Style*=-- , FinalMark={)}, Margin=0.5cm)
& Give an overview of the fundamental forces and particles.
& Discuss the Standard Model in detail, emphasising certain aspects as they relate to dark matter and the Higgs field (and boson).
& Briefly recap dark matter, referencing descriptions in introduction. But go into more theoretical descriptions and motivations and how they relate to potentially discovering it at the LHC (WIMP miracle). 
& Discuss the theory behind combined Higgs to inv.: only \acrshort{sm} process in which Higgs decays invisibly is $\PH \rightarrow \PZ\PZ \rightarrow 4\nu$ with branching ratio of 0.1\,\%~\cite{Heinemeyer:1559921}, whilst the current observed experimental limit is 19\,\% from CMS~\cite{Sirunyan:2018owy} and 26\,\% from \acrshort{atlas}~\cite{Aaboud:2019rtt}. If new, invisible particles couple to Higgs, branching ratio will be enhanced. Constraining \BR can also exclude some dark matter models.
& Discuss the theory behind the semi-visible jets analysis (main sources from Refs.~\citenum{Cohen:2015toa,Cohen:2017pzm}): strongly interacting dark sector in Hidden Valley scenario with a portal to the visible sector. Mentioning dark quarks \Pqdark, dark confinement scale \lamDark, dark hadronisation and decay, running coupling \aDark, etc.
& Explain some of the phenomenological/experimental event characteristics that overlap with both analyses, i.e., what a jet is, and maybe energy sums like \ptmiss, \HT, \htmiss, etc.

% Check Lancaster and other summer school notes for other limitations, specifically referencing things that can tie into dark matter

Despite the \acrlong{sm} providing precise predictions of three of the four fundamental forces and the particles that they interact with, there are many experimental observations that it cannot currently explain. Neutrino masses, dark matter, dark energy, and gravity all escape its description.

\section{Theoretical motivations for, and descriptions of, dark matter}
\label{sec:theory_dark_matter}

% Will probably be referring to things from introduction section. Try to just give overview there and describe the nitty-gritty here

The universe may have birthed dark matter via one of many possible mechanisms. The most popular is described as a ``thermal freeze-out'' process. In the hot, early universe when the thermal background allowed spontaneous pair production of particle dark matter, it was produced in abundance. During this period, they may also have frequently annihilated since the cosmos was still small. Inevitably, the universe expanded and cooled; the temperature became too low to allow significant production \cite{Baldes:2017gzw}. Matter was further separated and the dark matter annihilation rate decreased, leaving a behind the ``thermal relic'' that is observed today. These remaining particles were attracted via gravity, forming filaments throughout the universe. The potential wells they induced allowed the progenitors of galaxies to form within.

& It is thought that dark matter was produced thermally in the early universe (when it was hot and therefore easier to create heavy particles). Dark matter particles could (and did) annihilate, but as the universe expanded and cooled the dark matter became more diffuse. They didn't annihilate as often and the dark matter we see today is a "thermal relic" and is what's left over. Some models suggest the parameter $x = m_{\mathrm{DM}}/T \sim 20$ at freeze out. \cite{Lisanti:2016jxe} 

& The current leading dark matter candidate is a WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle), possibly a neutral supersymmetric particle (neutralino) like a higgsino, photino, zino, etc. One of the motivations for WIMPs are that, using the current values of the dark matter density in the universe and approximations for the annihilation cross section, dark matter could self-interact at the electroweak scale to produce Standard Model particles. \cite{Kamionkowski:1997zb} As the EW scale can be readily accessed at colliders like the LHC, we could detect DM signatures via pair production then annihilation or indirect searches via solely annihilation. % Also see student seminar talk for more info on WIMP miracle

& Because WIMPs are stable (at least on the timescale of the current age of the Universe), they wouldn't decay into other particles when produced from accelerator collisions. So you would detect them (indirectly) by looking for MET and by looking for visible particles recoiling against the WIMPs.

& The mediator (force-carrying particle, like the gauge bosons) for dark matter -- between dark matter particles or the dark matter-Standard Model particle interactions -- may be a scalar (spin-0, like the Higgs boson) or pseudoscalar (reverses parity under a Lorentz transformation, like the pion) boson. [Support] for a pseudoscalar over a scalar mediator comes from the Feynman diagrams for DM annihilation into, e.g., \Pqb-quarks. With a scalar mediator, the vertex factors and the propagator term lead to cancellations in the cross section equation in the low-velocity limit.

& The mediator for dark matter may be heavier than the dark matter particle itself (like with the $W^{\pm}$ and \PZ bosons being heavier than most of the particles they mediate), maybe 2x heavier or more so than the DM particle. The mediator could decay via DM pair production, so it makes sense that it would be at least twice as heavy.

& There's no consensus on whether dark matter is fermionic or bosonic. If fermionic, it may be either a Dirac fermion (particle is distinct from its antiparticle, like the electron and positron) or Majorana fermion (particle is the same as its antiparticle, like the neutrino is \underline{suspected} to be). If it were Majorana, dark matter could annihilate with itself, making discoveries via indirect searches more likely.

& At the LHC, monojets are used most prominently to look for dark matter particles. But multijet plus \etmiss might provide better sensitivity and constraints (particularly if the mediator is pseudoscalar).

& \underline{Many} dark matter candidates include a few supersymmetric particles (the neutralino being the most widely studied), sterile neutrinos \cite{doi:10.1142/S0218301313300191}, axions, Kaluza-Klein states \cite{Han:1998sg} (which are excitations of Standard Model fields in extra dimensions), etc.

& Some good results showcasing dark matter masses and that of its mediator from different analyses and decay channels are at \cite{CMS-DP-2016-057}. Particularly figures 4 and 6, which I used in my poster for the PGR conference.

\section{Important observables in collider physics}
\label{sec:theory_important_observables}


%=========================================================


\subsection{Transverse momentum (\texorpdfstring{\pt}{pt})}
\label{subsec:theory_pt}

In the LHC (or any other collider), the longitudinal momentum of the initial state particles is typically unknown. However, the momentum transverse to the beam is zero before the collision, and therefore must be zero afterward after due to momentum conservation. This is why the transverse momentum of a particle or physics object (\ptvec for the vector quantity, \pt for its magnitude) is a useful variable in an analysis.

% Do I need a more formal/mathematical definition, or a diagram?


%=========================================================


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\HT}{HT}}
\label{subsec:theory_ht}

% Will need to define what a jet is here if I don't do so before

The scalar sum of the transverse momentum of hadronic constituents in an event, i.e., the \glspl{jet}, is symbolised as \HT. It is often used in analyses focused on hadronic objects, such as natural \acrlong{susy} in which a large jet multiplicity is expected. Formally,

\begin{equation}
    \HT \equiv \sum_{\mathrm{jets}} \pt
    \label{eq:ht_definition}
\end{equation}

Typically, a lower limit on \pt is used when calculating the \HT, so jets below this threshold do not factor into the sum. This is to avoid low momentum jets attributed to pileup events (see Chpt. [REF PU IN DETECTOR CHAP.]), and those from the primary vertex that can often be mismeasured.


%=========================================================


\subsection{Missing transverse momentum (\texorpdfstring{\ptmiss}{ptmiss})}
\label{subsec:theory_met}

The missing transverse momentum \ptmiss is defined as the negative vector sum of the \pt of all identified particles in an event. It is a term often used interchangeably with \gls{met} (MET, \glssymbol{met}). Undetected particles from neutrinos or dark matter, or mismeasured kinematic properties of identified particles, will introduce an imbalance in the vector sum of the \pt. Hence, the \ptmiss will be non-zero. Formally,

\begin{equation}
    \ptmiss \equiv - \sum_i^{N_{\mathrm{particles}}} {\vec p}_{\mathrm{T}, \, i}
    \label{eq:met_definition}
\end{equation}

The hadronic-only counterpart to this variable, \mht, is the negative vector sum of the jet transverse momenta in an event:

\begin{equation}
    \mht \equiv - \sum_j^{N_{\mathrm{jets}}} {\vec p}_{\mathrm{T}, \, j}
    \label{eq:mht_definition}
\end{equation}

As with \HT, the \mht is often calculated with a lower limit on the jet \pt.

% A depiction of the MET (e.g., SM particles recoiling off dark matter) might be useful for the reader
