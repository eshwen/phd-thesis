\chapter*{Abstract}

\initial{D}ark matter is a poorly-understood phenomenon in nature. Though substantial evidence corroborates its existence, only few characteristics have been determined. One goal of The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is to produce dark matter in high energy proton-proton collisions, potentially allowing insight into its currently-mysterious origins. Many hypotheses have been postulated regarding its nature, two of which are investigated in this thesis: invisible decays of the Higgs boson, and the production of semi-visible jets. The data used is from the LHC Run-2 era and recorded by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137\fbinv at a centre of mass energy of 13\TeV.

The branching ratio of the Higgs boson to invisible states is predicted as 0.1\,\% in the standard model. Enhancements from a coupling to dark matter may be detectable at the LHC. A search is performed in final states comprising jets and missing transverse momentum targeting three of the Higgs boson's production modes: \ttH, \VH, and \ggH. With the full Run-2 dataset from CMS, no significant deviation from the standard model was observed. Results are presented as an upper limit on the measured cross section times branching ratio over the standard model Higgs boson cross section at a 95,\% confidence level. For the \ttH-tagged, \VH-tagged, and \ggH-tagged events, observed (expected) limits of XX (YY), XX (YY), and XX (YY), respectively were achieved. A combined Run-2 limit of XX was observed and YY expected. Interpretations are provided in simplified dark matter scenarios.

Dark matter may exist in a Hidden Valley dark sector connected to the visible universe via a leptophobic mediator. Analogous to QCD, dark quarks may be produced in the LHC, hadronising and decaying into a mixture of visible and invisible particles (a semi-visible jet). The behaviour of simulated signal from $s$- and \tchannel production modes in the CMS detector---and variables discriminating it from background---is explored. The transverse mass of the dijet system was found to be the most effective.
